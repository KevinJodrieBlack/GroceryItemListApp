# GroceryItemListApp

This is a C++ application that takes a list of strings and records there frequency to referenced later. In this example it is used to return the amount of times a particular gorcery item appears in a list. It can provide a specefic item by search, or it can print out the quantities either numerically or by histogram. 

In this project I kept to best practices in OOP by seperating the functionality into classes to reduce the responsibility of each class. This also had the benefit of making the main function very readible. 

The searches are still currently case sensitive, which is something I would like to fix soon.

Working on this project helped me practice my modular design, which is something I will continue to take into my future projects
